Homework #Trivia Game

This is a simple Triva Game with four questions with a 2 minute timer.

 My implementation of this homework deviated from jquery, which I still not cofortable with while still maintaining the guidelines for the homework.   

I got the implementation to work but I didn't get the reset.
